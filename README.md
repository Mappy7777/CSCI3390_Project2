**Project 2 Submission for Shane Fitzpatrick & Michael Guyon**

1. The output for Exact F2 was as follows:
Exact F2. Time elapsed:26s. Estimate: 8567966130


2. The output for Tug-of-War was as follows:
Tug-of-War F2 Approximation. Width :10. Depth: 3. Time elapsed:35s. Estimate: 5677422246


3. The output for BJKST was as follows:
BJKST Algorithm. Bucket Size:3. Trials:5. Time elapsed:10s. Estimate: 8388608.0


4. The output for exact F0 was as follows:
Exact F0. Time elapsed:23s. Estimate: 7406649
BJKST ran in half of the time as computing the exact F0. The estimate was also less than 20% off of the actual F0. So overall the BJKST performed very well. The Tug-of-War did not perform very well compared to the actual F2 value. It took 20 seconds longer to run and was off by almost 40%. However neither was off by a massive factor (10 or more) so neither Tug-of-War or BJKST was a total failure.
